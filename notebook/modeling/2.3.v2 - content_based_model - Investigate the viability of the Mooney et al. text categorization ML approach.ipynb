       "'The right answer is That is in be forged theres no way to the protection mechanism that is built into language So if I have a data structure defined In And if nI have pointer to the data structure the only way you can use that pointer as a pointer to that type of data structure You cannot take a data structure cast it to appear like something else this is something that we as C maybe very used to doing but not something that is possible in that is what us to implement protection in and to as by the is a concrete example of an Its a fairly standard implementation say operating system but it is an extension on top of the spin is a more fun example A client application that is directly on top spin as an extension In other is no operating system A display client an extension interface to implement the for video that is going to sent by a video server So both of these are on top of basic and provide exactly the functionality that for the video server application And bounding box here is showing spin and thereof And similarly the bounding box is showing spin and the extension thereof In this case nit is an entire operating system in this case it is just client of the video server And in this case it is the video server itself as an extension on top of now we set the stage for the spin and the extensibility of the operating system without losing out on or performance Both these with two The first premise that based design non performance due to frequent border the second premise is that monolithic design does not lend itself to Because of the starting of spin and these have certain commonality in what they strive to although the path taken by these two are very now turn our attention to the issue of and some of the that have been taken to achieve this Historically I should mention that there was interest in at least as far back as With a that was at the operating system The operating system provided kernel resource allocation The key word is not just for resource in the kernel And it had na way of providing access to a capability based approach The notion a capability a special the operating system literature And that it is an entity that can be from one to the nother Cannot be forged And can All of the that want in order to make sure that The system integrity is not as in this abstract notion of capability And as originally was a heavyweight mechanism in of it efficiently in nan operating system And because capability a heavyweight mechanism The operating resource were built as in order to reduce border crossing overhead because border in the system would mean you have to pass capability from one object to another And validate capability for entering a particular object and so on and for that used to resource That way they can the border crossing overhead And resource as also that it the and extensibility In other word closer you make these object the less opportunity you have for Which is exactly the against monolithic kernel as well So in principle had all right of providing minimal the kernel And the resource implement because the mechanism for the was through this capability is a heavy weight abstract notion to implement efficiently In practice did not fully achieve its goal of extensibility One of most extensible operating system of the early s was the system from It was providing very limited in the And all the that you expect an operating system as server that run as normal level above the kernel And clearly with this micro kernel based its goal of So it on And The is portability And the rub Performance took a because was very much non making the operating system portable across in addition to paying to extensibility And this unfortunately gave na bad press for based design Because it on these twin of portability and extensibility to take a And since are generally so non performance This design choice in supporting portability gave design na bad press But later on when look at L approach to design we will revisit the right to build a design But in this lesson focus on Spin to Extensibility So the key idea in spin is to na minimal kernel with its extension in the same hardware address space avoid the border crossing between the of The kernel and of the that are the specific the need And this core location also that we avoid border crossing which he said is one of the biggest for losing on performance But if going to the kernel and in the same address space that compromising on Wasnt that the strike against the structure that we about the approach that Spin took was to on the of a strongly language that the compiler can enforce the we need in order to give the protection So by a strongly in the case of Spin they used modular three more on that in a minute Colonel is able to provide Well defined all of you may be familiar with function in na file and the actual implementation the in other In a large project this is the same that is now taken to the design of the operating system itself After all system is also a piece of na complex piece of and why not a strongly language as the basis building the operating system Thats the idea in spin approach Now what you get when use a strongly language is that you cheat For instance in a language like you can type cast so that a data structure can be differently depending on what you need get done At the moment Thats not possible with a strongly language provided by the such as an object serve as for logical protection That is are no longer reliant on hardware to provide the protection between different the kernel As I the kernel only the and these protection actually implement the that is in those And there can be of the interface thats where the comes can dynamically bind different of the same thats how we get different of specific system Getting the flexibility that you want an operating system Because have the kernel and the in the same hardware address space we are making the as as a procedure call So in a nutshell what weve accomplished with na Spin approach to extensibility as we are writing on of a strongly language that strong and therefore the operating system to implement logical protection instead of on hardware And consequently were making as cheap as procedure operating system to feel external For example external that may come in when a process is Or the process may incur some such as a page Or it may make system All of these are that needs to be by the operating system and SPIN support such external And SPIN such external an event based communication model can register are event with the SPIN event dispatcher and SPIN several of It support a one one between an event and a handler nIt also support one to many between an event and the And it many to one many to the same handler And at concrete to illustrate the power this and how it might help building system And what this picture showing you is a typical protocol stack you may have several different available on machine And therefore a network packet may arrive one of several say you have nan interface and you have an interface nA network packet may arrive on the port nor an port Those are and both those may be in which case is an handler that needs to see And so here is an example of many to the same packet arrival is an event arrival is an event different but map the same handler which is the nIP handler Thats an example of of the packet by this in an packet arrival event there will be several of the nIP layer of the protocol stack There will be transport there will be transport there will an layer And they are all sitting non top of this network layer So when nan packet arrival event is figured by this there are multiple for that and this an example of a one to many none event to multiple that need get triggered And the SPIN dispatcher number of to be registered as a particular event type And when that type is then all the associated with that event type will get by the SPIN dispatcher The order in they get is not something that designer can count on because SPIN in the which these event get when a particular event arise all the that are associated with an will get triggered when that event is Thats an example of one to many finally here is an example of a one to one If its an packet handler the packet and it is an packet then it nan event than an packet maybe there is only one client for that event and that may be the ping program so thats one two on Even may also be with of grain handler execution For example this handler could specify only when arrive it should be executed So thats a guard that packet handler could specify so that even though different of may arrive on these this handler will only get when the packet that non the different than now we know the toolbox provided SPIN for building an operating system Now none can build each of the we about early on that an operating should provide Such as memory management file system network protocol stack so on from scratch as SPIN As we know memory management and are core that operating system should provide However nan extensible operating system should not how these should be interface for in the operating system memory is a precious resource know that native operating such or the physical memory that is available from the SPIN to allow to manage physical memory to in whatever fashion they choose to The of a bunch physical memory to an extension its outside the scope of this discussion assume that the allocation of a bunch of physical memory when an up The discussion in this tablet frame is to do with the of the physical memory by extension The interface that you here from memory management are header provided by SPIN For example a page frame a page frame na page frame Similarly a virtual page or a virtual page which might be used for dynamic memory allocation to do with and address or removing between virtual and physical All of those interface that are provided as header by SPIN And memory management because of we said about of memory all of a addr'"
